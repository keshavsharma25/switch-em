SwitchEm: Cross-Chain Token Bridge using ERC-7683 ðŸ”„

A seamless cross-chain token bridge that leverages ERC-7683 (Cross Chain Intents) to enable effortless movement of ERC20 tokens across Layer 2 networks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Moving tokens across different L2 networks often involves:

- Complex bridging processes
- Multiple transaction approvals
- High risk of user error
- Lack of transaction visibility
- Poor UX with multiple bridge interfaces

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
SwitchEm provides a unified interface to move ERC20 tokens across Layer 2 networks using the ERC-7683 standard for Cross Chain Intents. Think of it as a "universal remote control" for your tokens across L2s.

## âš¡ Key Features
One-click token transfers between supported L2s
Real-time transaction status tracking
Gasless approvals using ERC-7683 intents
Support for popular ERC20 tokens
Unified interface for multiple L2 networks
Built-in slippage protection
Transaction history and activity monitoring
